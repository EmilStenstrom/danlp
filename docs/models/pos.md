Part of Speech Tagging
===============
This section is concerned with public available Part of Speech taggers in Danish.

The Danish UD treebank  uses 17 [universal part of speech tags](<https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html>):
`ADJ`: Adjective   `ADP`: Adposition `ADV`: Adverb `AUX`: Auxiliary verb `CONJ`: Coordinating conjunction `DET`: determiner `INTJ`: interjection `NOUN`: Noun `NUM`: Numeral `PART`: Particle `PRON`: Pronoun `PROPN`: Proper noun `PUNCT`: Punctuation `SCONJ`: Subordinating conjunction `SYM`: Symbol `VERB`: Verb `X`: Other

*The polyglot model originates from the paper Akbik Al-Rfou et al. 2013, where the model is trained and tested on 12 universal part of speech tags originating from Petrov et al., 2012.  The reported test accuracy is  on 96,45%. In the meantime, the [documentation](<https://polyglot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/POS.html>) report that the model recognizes the 17 universal part of speech tags.

## Training details for Flair PoS tagger

This project provides a trained part of speech tagging model for Danish using the Flair framework from Zalendo.

It is trained using the data from  [Danish UD treebank  ](<https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Danish-DDT/tree/master>), and by using FastText word embeddings and Flair contextual word embeddings trained in this project on data from Wikipedia and EuroParl corpus, see [here](<https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/docs/models/embeddings.md>) .

The code for training can be found on Flairs GitHub, and the following parameters are set:              learning_rate=1, mini_batch_size=32, max_epochs=150, hidden_size=256.

The accuracy reported is from from the test set provided by Danish Dependecy Treebank on a single run. Notice,  Flair report in Akbij et. al 2018 an accuracy on 97,84 +/- 0,01 for the English POS tagger, which the Danish result is rather close to.




## Get started using Part of speech tagging

Below is a small snippet for getting started with the Flair part of speech tagger trained by Alexandra Institute, but more examples can be found on [Flair](<https://github.com/zalandoresearch/flair>) GitHub page. 

```python
from danlp.models.pos_taggers import load_pos_tagger_with_flair
from flair.data import Sentence

# Load the POS tagger using the DaNLP wrapper
flair_model = load_pos_tagger_with_flair()

# Using the flair POS tagger
sentence = Sentence('jeg hopper pÃ¥ en bil som er rÃ¸d sammen med Jens-Peter E. Hansen') 
flair_model.predict(sentence) 
print(sentence.to_tagged_string())
```



## Applications ideas

Part of speech tagging has several applications. The distributions of part of speech tags can characterize a text, and it can for example be used as surface features, indicating how many word of each tags are present in the text. Knowing the tags is also relevant if you want to find the lemma of a word. An idea for use could also concern text augmentation, where you want to make small permutation to you text. This could be done by finding a token with a certain part of speech tag, eg. noun, and then find and shift a similar noun using e.g a word2vec model. In that way the structure of the sentence is preserved.
