Sentiment Analysis
============================

Sentiment analysis is a broad term for a set of tasks with the purpose of identifying an emotion or opinion in a text.

In this repository we provide an overview of open sentiment analysis models and dataset for Danish.

#### Under development

- A training set, and models for polarity classification (in three class: positive, negative, neutral)
- A training set, and models for subjectivity/objectivity classification



#### AFINN

The [AFINN](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn) tool [(Nielsen 2011)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2903) uses a lexicon based approach for sentiment analysis.
The tool scores texts with an integer where scores <0 are negative, =0 are neutral and >0 are positive. 


#### Sentida
The tool Sentida  [(Lauridsen et al. 2019)](https://tidsskrift.dk/lwo/article/view/115711)
uses a lexicon based approach to sentiment analysis. The tool scores texts with a continuous value. There exist to versions of the tool where the second version is an implementation in Python:  [Sentida](https://github.com/esbenkc/emma) and in these documentations we evaluate this  second version. 

#### :wrench:Bert Emotion

The emotion classifier is developed in an collaboration with Danmarks Radio, which has granted access to a set of social media data.  The data has been manual annotated first to distinguished between a binary problem of emotion or no emotion, and afterwards tagged with 8 emotions. The model is finetuned using the transformer implementation from [huggingface](<https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>) and a pretrained Danish BERT model trained by [BotXo](<https://github.com/botxo/nordic_bert>). The model to classify the eight emotions achieves an accuracy on 0.65 and a macro-f1 on 0.64 on the social media test set from DR's Facebook containing 999 examples. We do not have permission to distributing the data. However a small test set on twitter data will soon be available. 


## üìà Benchmarks  
##### Benchmark of polarity classification

The benchmark is made by converting the relevant models scores and relevant datasets scores 
into the there classes 'positive', 'neutral' and 'negative'.

The tools are benchmarked on the following datasets:

- [LCC Sentiment](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/docs/datasets.md#lcc-sentiment) contains 499 sentences from the proceedings of the European Parliament annotated with a sentiment score from -5 to 5 by Finn √Örup Nielsen.
- [Europarl Sentiment](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/docs/datasets.md#europarl-sentiment) contains 184 sentences from news and web pages annotated with sentiment -5 to 5 by Finn √Örup Nielsen.

A conversion of the scores of the LCC and Europarl Sentiment dataset and the Afinn model is done in the following way: a score of zero to be "neutral", a positive score to be "positive" and a negative score to be "negative". 

An conversion of the continuous scores of the Sentida tool into three classes is not given since the 'neutral' class  can not be assumed to be only exactly zero but instead we assume it to be an area around zero.  We looked for a threshold to see how closed to zero a score should be to be interpreted as neutral.   A symmetric threshold is found by optimizing the macro-f1 score on a twitter sentiment corpus (with 1327 examples (the corpus is under construction and will be released later on)) . The threshold is found to be 0.4, which makes our chosen conversion to be:  scores over 0.4 to be 'positive', under -0.4 to be 'negative'  and scores between to be neutral. 

The script for the benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/examples/benchmarks/sentiment_benchmark.py).
In the table we consider the accuracy and macro-f1 in brackets, but to get the scores per class we refer to our benchmark script.

| Tool | Europarl Sentiment | LCC Sentiment |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| AFINN | **0.68** (0.68) | **0.66** (0.61) |
| Sentida | 0.67 (0.65) | 0.58 (0.55) |



## :hatching_chick: Getting started 

 Below is a small snippet for getting started using the Bert Emotion model:

```python
from danlp.models import load_bert_emotion_model
classifier = load_bert_emotion_model()

# using the classifier
classifier.predict('bilen er flot')
''''No emotion''''
classifier.predict('jeg ejer en r√∏d bil og det er en god bil')
''''Tillid/Accept''''
classifier.predict('jeg ejer en r√∏d bil men den er g√•et i stykker')
''''Sorg/trist''''
```



 

## **üë∑** Construction of a new dataset  in process

This project is in the process of creating a manual annotating dataset to use in training of new sentiment analysis models. The dataset will be open source and therefore it is using data from varied source such as twitter and [europarl data](<http://www.statmt.org/europarl/>). 

Another approach is to use a "silver" annotated corpus e.g. by using user-reviews and ratings. An example os this is The NoReC corpus [(Velldal et al. 2018)](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/851.pdf)  which is a dataset for sentiment analysis in Norwegian based on reviews from many Norwegian news organizations.
The DaNLP project hope to create a similar dataset in Danish with permission from the copyright holders.
So if you manage a site containing user reviews for example movie reviews and would like to contribute then please contact us.

## Zero-shot Cross-lingual transfer example

An example of utilizing an dataset in another language to be able to make predicts on Danish without seeing Danish training data is shown in this 
[notebok](<https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/sentiment-start/examples/Zero_shot_sentiment_analysi_example.ipynb>). It is trained on English movie reviews from IMDB, and
it uses multilingual embeddings from [Artetxe et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10464.pdf) called 
[LASER](<https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER>)(Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations).
