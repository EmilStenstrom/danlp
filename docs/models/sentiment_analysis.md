Sentiment Analysis
============================

Sentiment analysis refers to identifying an emotion or opinion in a text.
The following focuses on the polarity of a sentence i.e. the tone of positive, neutral or negative.
In this repository we provide an overview of available sentiment analysis models and dataset for Danish. 

In Danish there is so-far no open source annotated training set. 
Two sentiment analysis tools currently exist in Danish. 

| Model                                              | Type     | License                    | Trained by               | Tags                                                         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [AFINN](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/docs/models/sentiment_analysis.md#afinn) | Wordlist | [Apache 2.0](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn/blob/master/LICENSE) | Finn Ã…rup Nielsen | Score (integers) |
| [Sentida](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/docs/models/sentiment_analysis.md#sentida) | Wordlist | [GPL-3.0](https://github.com/esbenkc/emma/blob/master/LICENSE) | SÃ¸ren Orm and Esben Kran | Score (continuous) |

#### AFINN
The [AFINN](https://github.com/fnielsen/afinn) tool [(Nielsen 2011)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2903) uses a lexicon based approach for sentiment analysis.
The tool scores texts with an integer where scores <0 are negative, =0 are neutral and >0 are positive. 


#### Sentida
The [Sentida](https://github.com/esbenkc/emma) tool [(Lauridsen et al. 2019)](https://tidsskrift.dk/lwo/article/view/115711)
uses a lexicon based approach to sentiment analysis. The tool scores texts with a continuous value, where <0 are negative, =0 are neutral and >0 are positive.
It exists in two versions, and in these documentations we consider the version two.


## ðŸ“ˆ Benchmarks 
The benchmark is made by grouping the relevant models scores and relevant datasets scores 
into the there classes defined as follows: a score of zero to be neutral, a positive score to be positive and a negative score to be negative. 

The tools are benchmarked on the following datasets:

- [LCC Sentiment](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/docs/datasets.md#lcc-sentiment) contains 184 sentences from the proceedings of the European Parliament annotated with a sentiment score from -5 to 5 by Finn Ã…rup Nielsen.
- [Europarl Sentiment](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/docs/datasets.md#europarl-sentiment) contains 499 sentences from news and web pages annotated with sentiment -5 to 5 by Finn Ã…rup Nielsen.

The script for the benchmarks can be found [here](https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/master/examples/benchmarks/sentiment_benchmark.py).
In the table we consider only the accuracy, but to get the scores per class we refer to our benchmark script.

| Tool | Europarl Sentiment | LCC Sentiment |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| AFINN | **0.68**  | **0.66** |
| Sentida | 0.49 | 0.38 |

## **ðŸ‘·** Construction of a new dataset  in process
The NoReC corpus [(Velldal et al. 2018)](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2018/pdf/851.pdf) 
is a dataset for sentiment analysis in Norwegian based on reviews from many Norwegian news organizations.
The DaNLP project hope to create a similar dataset in Danish with permission from the copyright holders.
So if you manage a site containing user reviews for example movie reviews and would like to contribute then please contact us.

## Zero-shot Cross-lingual transfer example

An example of utilizing an dataset in another language to be able to make predicts on Danish without seeing Danish training data is shown in this 
[notebok](<https://github.com/alexandrainst/danlp/blob/sentiment-start/examples/Zero_shot_sentiment_analysi_example.ipynb>). It is trained on English movie reviews from IMDB, and
it uses multilingual embeddings from [Artetxe et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.10464.pdf) called 
[LASER](<https://github.com/facebookresearch/LASER>)(Language-Agnostic SEntence Representations).
