Examples
========

Here you will find examples and tutorials on how to use NLP in Danish.

Some of the examples make use of the DaNLP pip package and show how to use the 
package. Other examples focus on different use case e.g. applying cross-transfer 
learning on Danish. 

The `benchmark` folder contains scripts to reproduce the benchmark results reported for the models in the docs in this project.
